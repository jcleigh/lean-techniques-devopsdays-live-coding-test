# lean-techniques-devopsdays-live-coding-test
A from-memory recreation of the live coding test that Lean Techniques had attendees attempt at DevOpsDays Des Moines 2023 conference. There was a leaderboard and the top 3 fastest attempts won a prize. The top score was 5 minutes, 1 millisecond.

The actual integers used in the test assertions differ from what the LT test used, because I didn't memorize them verbatim. The test flow directly mimics the test provided by LT at DevOpsDays.
