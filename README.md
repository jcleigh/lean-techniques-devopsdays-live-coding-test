# lean-techniques-devopsdays-live-coding-test
A from-memory recreation of the live coding test that [Lean Techniques](https://leantechniques.com/) offered as a contest at [DevOpsDays Des Moines 2023 conference](https://devopsdays.org/events/2023-des-moines/welcome/). There was a leaderboard and the top 3 fastest attempts won a prize. 

The top score was **5 minutes, 1 millisecond**.

*Note:* The actual integers used in the test assertions differ from what the LT test used, because I didn't memorize them verbatim. The test flow directly mimics the test provided by LT at DevOpsDays.

## Instructions
- Open `index.spec.js` and `index.js` in your IDE
- Run `npm test` to execute the Jest test runner
- Add logic to `calculator()` until it passes one or more unit tests
- Repeat until all the tests pass
- **Bonus: time yourself to see if you can beat the record!**

## Note regarding AI-assisted programming
The contest did not have Copilot, GPT, etc. enabled. Speed becomes quite trivial if using one of these tools, so try it without first!
